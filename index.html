					<h2>Hi! </h2>
					<p>This is my website. I think computers are really neat, and I ended up trying to make some games and other things.
					If you're so inclined, feel free to check them out! I hope you find them interesting, because I sure do.
					</p>

					<p>Most things require downloads, so if you're on mobile, the only thing you can really take a look at is Clicky. (Given that the website works at all on mobile, that is.)</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>I'm currently working on a project that allows you to make and mess with simulations 
					where you can create logic gates and utilize other digital (and maybe even other) logic.
					It's not quite ready to hand out, but the basics are functional, and it's even got a wiki!
					</p>
					<button oncLick="nav(&#34;Crystalarium/index.html&#34;)">Crystalarium</button>
					
					<p>I also made a programming language, mostly to learn a bit about how they work. If you'd like to try it out (for some reason), a download and documentation is below.</p>
					<button oncLick="nav(&#34;AFL/index.html&#34;)">AFL</button>
					
					<p>For a while, I thought it would be neat to make a super involved idle/clicker game. I never actually made that, but I did try a few times to make a more basic one. 
					You can see those attempts here: </p>
					<button oncLick="nav(&#34;Clicky/index.html&#34;)">Clicky</button>
				  
					
						
					<p>And here's a <a href="https://github.com/fuzzy39"> link to my github</a> while we're at it, I guess.</p>
