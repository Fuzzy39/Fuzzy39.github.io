					<h2>Hi!</h2>
					<p>This is my website. I, uh, make things, on occasion, for fun. Mostly programming stuff and little games- including this page.
					You're welcome to play/mess with some of them hosted here,
					but be warned, some of them are OLD, and others might require downloads. Have fun, I guess!
					</p>

					<p>Ooh- and a quick note: If you're on mobile, this website is not at all built for that, so... Sorry! I'll fix that at some point, probably. At least most
					things work, if incredibly tiny.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>I've made some iterations on a basic clicker/idle game, which I've called clicky, because I'm amazing at naming things. Try them out below.</p>
					<button oncLick="nav(&#34;Clicky/index.html&#34;)">Clicky</button>
				  
					<p>I also made a programming language, mostly to learn a bit about how they work. If you'd like to try it out (for some reason), a download and documentation is below.</p>
					<button oncLick="nav(&#34;AFL/index.html&#34;)">AFL</button>
					
					<p>And here's a <a href="https://github.com/qwerty4967"> link to my github</a> while we're at it, I guess.</p>
					<p >Uhh... Thanks for taking a look at a random website. I hope you have a nice day, and remember that this website contains no secrets whatsoever.</p>
