	for those of you wondering, "how did this kid make this? is it wix, wordpress or sqarespace?"
	I want you to be aware that this was made with Adobe Dreamweaver, thanks to my school probably 
    having some deal with adobe. It was also tested with only google chrome, so if it breaks on 
	other browsers, sorry.

	thanks for taking the time to look at the HTML.

					<h2>Welcome</h2>
					<p> to my corner of the internet. I am a novice programmer who makes things in my spare time. I am most familiar with java, but I am not expericenced in anything really. If you want to see some things I made, go ahead and stick around. Or whatever. I'm not your boss.

					<p>Ooh- and while you're still here, let me take the opportunity to sell myself.</p>

					<p>A lot of the things I make could be called games, so... if you're bored or something, you can click right here.</p>
