					<p> To my corner of the internet. I am a hobbyist programmer who makes a few things in my spare time; I'm pretty sure I have a clue about what I'm doing. Probably. If you want to see some stuff I made, go ahead and stick around. Or whatever. You do you.
					</p>

					<p>Ooh- while still you're here, let me take the opportunity to sell myself.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>I've made some online interactives. They're mostly games at present, but I might put other stuff there at somepoint. I reccomend Clicky3, which is a gold-mining idle game. Feel free to check it and a couple others out below.</p>
					<button oncLick="nav(&#34;games/index.html&#34;)">Interactives</button>
				  
					<p>Some other stuff that I made Isn't very browser friendly, so you can download those here, If you are interested.</p>
					<button oncLick="nav(&#34;downloads.html&#34;)">Downloads</button>
					<p>And here's a link to my github while we're at it: <a href="https://github.com/qwerty4967">qwerty4967</a></p>
					<p >Uhh... Thanks for taking a look at a random website. I hope you have a nice day, and remember that this website contains no secrets whatsoever.</p>
