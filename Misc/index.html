					<h2>Ah, what's this?</h2>
					<p>It's surpsising, I know, I have made things that don't fall into the very specific other tabs. And they're here! Most of them are downloads though, so be wary of that.
					Also, I would doubt any work on mac either. Oh well.

						<p>
						Ziker 3 is the predecessor to AFL. Here's what I wrote about it at the time:
						"I tried to make a programming shell. It's pretty primitive. It has an interactive help system, but to learn how it works, I 
						would use Examples.txt. Have fun messing around, if you care.
						
						Also, for mac users, it expects the folder to be on your desktop."

						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Project Earth v0.1.0.766.zip&#34;)">Project Earth v0.1.0</button>
						<p>
						 I tried to make a... thing. It didn't ever really get finished, but in it's current state it's a map generator. It's pretty custimizable, but don't set the map size too high or it lags. Windows only.
						 I made it with Monogame, and I still like the idea so I might revisit it in some form.

						 Possibly the oldest thing on this site. It's a tiny little text adventure thing. See if you can get all 6 endings!
