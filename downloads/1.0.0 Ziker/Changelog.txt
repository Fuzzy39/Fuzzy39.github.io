Current Bugs
 --------------------

        
* "====" is handled as ==, =, = instead of ==, ==.
	suggested solution:
		ignore. any situation where this error occurs is bound to be 
		invalid, and will not produce a different result. 
		
* "++" and "--" act as "+" instead of producing errors
	This will be fixed at some point.
	
* and many more, probably...
