					<h2> Operators
					</h2><hr>
					<p>AFL uses operators to describe basic operations, such as the + operator for addition. All 
Operators have two operands, to each side of them. AFL utilizes the order of operations,
with certain operations being executed before others. This entry describes Each 'priority 
category' of operators from highest to lowest priority, with notes for certain operators 
when required.</p>
					
					<h3>Organize Category Operators</h3>
					<p> ( and ) are Organize operators, but they do not correspond to any operations, and
prioritize the expression inside of them, ensuring all of it is done as a unit.
Parenthesees are also used to describe function calls, but are used in a slightly different
capacity. Here is an example of parentheses used as organize operators:</p>
					<div class="code"><p>4*2+3; # outputs 11
4*(2+3) # outputs 20</p></div>
					
					<h3>Multiply Category Operators</h3>
					<p>The multiply category operators are *, /, and %, and perform multiplication, division, and
modulus (division remainders) respectively on num type operands.</p>
					
					<h3>Add Category Operators</h3>
					<p>The add category operators are + and -, and perform addition and subtraction respectively on
num type operands.
+ can also utilize operands of other types, and if any operand of + is not a num,
it will concatenate both types together and output a string.</p>
					
					<h3>Compare Category Operators</h3>
					<p>The compare category operators are ==, !=, >=, <=, >, and <. These operators
return a boolean value. == and != compare equality and inequality respectively, and work on
all types. >=, <=, >, and < compare greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, greater
than, and less than respectively.
</p>
					
					<h3>Logic Category Operators</h3>
					<p>The logic category operators are || and &, and perform boolean or and and operations.
or returns true if either operand is true, and and returns true only if both operand are 
true.</p>
					
					<h3>Assignment Category Operators</h3>
					<p>= is the Assignment operator, which is used to assign variables. Refer to the entry on 
Variables for information on how it works. </p>
