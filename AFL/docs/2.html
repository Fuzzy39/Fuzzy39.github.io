					<h2> AFL Basics
					</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>This help entry contains a broad overview for a number of basic topics required to 
understand most AFL code. Hopefully most of it is relatively straightforward.</p>
					
					<h3>Data Types</h3>
					<p>AFL has various types of data that you can manipulate, and has specific ways of writing them
as constants. The various types are num, string, char, bool, array, and type. For more 
information on data types, see their corresponding entry.
</p>
					<h3>Printing</h3>
					<p>AFL has no print statement. If you want to print something to the console, just type it out!
Here are some examples:</p>
					<div class="code"><p>"Hello, World!"</p></div>
					<div class="code"><p>1+1</p></div>
					<div class="code"><p>round(1.1)</p></div>
					
					<h3>Multiple Statements</h3>
					<p>Statements in an AFL program are separated by semicolons. This is always the case, no matter
where the semicolon is in AFL code. Because statements are separated by semicolons, and not 
ended by them, AFL expects the last statement in a piece of code to not be ended by a 
semicolon. If you want to use a semicolon in a way that does not denote a new statement,
you can escape them with a backslash. See the entry on escape sequences to learn more about
escaping other characters.</p>
					<p>
					If you are typing a program in the shell, pressing enter after typing a semicolon will let
you write multiple lines of code, though putting multiple statements in a single line is 
also valid.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Variables & Arrays</h3>
					<p>AFL supports variables, which are used to store values. Assigning a variable is fairly 
simple:</p>
					<div class="code"><p>x = 2+1;
"x squared:";
x*x</p></div>
					<p>If you want more specific information on variables and variable scoping, check out the 
entry on variables below.</p>
					<p>AFL also supports arrays, which are special variables that can store multiple values. Check
out the entry on arrays for more information.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Comments</h3>
					<p>AFL provides ways to insert comments that are not executed into your code, usually to
explain the function of your code. AFL uses # to denote a comment for a single line, though
note that semicolons in comments have to be escaped.</p>
					<h3>Operators and Functions</h3>
					<p>AFL provides various ways to modify values. These include operators such as +, *, and ==,
and functions, such as round(num) and random(). Functions in particular do not have to
output any value, however. You can also create your own functions. To learn how to make and
call functions, see the corresponding entry on functions below.</p>
					<h3>Control Statements</h3>
					<p>AFL also supports what it calls control statements, which are functions that modify the flow
of code execution. These include the commonplace if(bool) and while(bool). To see syntax for 
them and a list of all control statements, see the corresponding entry below</p>
