					<h2> Data Types
					</h2><hr>
					<p>AFL has various types of data that you can manipulate, and has various ways as writing them
as constants. All types of data can be put into variables. This Entry contains a list of
data types, how to enter them as constants, and some assorted notes on them.</p>
					<h3>num</h3>
					<p>The num data type is for storing numbers. All num's are double precision floating points,
completely stolen from java. They may be entered as expected for the most part, but AFL
refuses to recognize scientific notation, values like NaN and Infinity, and negative numbers
as numbers, when written as constants, though these values can still be obtained with 
expressions. Note that there is a utility function for producing a negative number, 
neg(num).</p>
					<h3>string</h3>
					<p>The string data type represents text, and is written as a constant using quotation marks,
like so:</p>
<div class="code"><p>"Hello, World!"</p></div>
<p>
Strings can be easily combined (or other types can be appended on to strings) by using the
+ operator. They can also be converted to and from arrays of char type data using the
toCharArray(string) and fromCharArray(array) functions. Certain characters cannot be easily 
inputed into strings, and for these characters, escape sequences are available. See the
entry below for more information.</p>
				<h3>char</h3>
				<p>The char data type represents a single character, such as 'a', '!' or '1'. They are
represented by single quotes surrounding the character in question, like shown above.
Certain characters cannot be easily inputed, and for these characters escape sequences 
are available. See the entry below for more information.</p>	
				<h3>bool</h3>
				<p>The bool data type represents true or false, and are the results of comparisons e.g. x>10. 
They are represented by the words true and false, fittingly enough. </p>
				<h3>array</h3>
				<p>The array data type cannot be directly represented, though they are stored in variables.
They are manipulated through array functions. arrays represent multiple values in one,
indexable by a num. For more information on arrays and how to use them, see the 
corresponding entry.</p>
				<h3>type</h3>
				<p>The type data type represents the data types, num, string, char, bool, array and type, and
are written as such. types are used most often when determining the type of a potentially
unknown variable, typically like so:</p>
				<div class="code"><p>if(typeOf(x)==num);
    # do something if x is a num
end();
else();
    # do something if x is not a num
end()</p></div>
