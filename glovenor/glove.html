            <h3>Gloveism</h3>
            <h4>Disclaimer:</h4>
        <p>I must inform you that that none of this is believed nor is it true, and I do not mean to offend any one with this. It is a joke.</p>
        
        <h4>Who made the universe?</h4>
        <p>This question has plagued theologians and philosophers for millenia. We have recently found the answer. In 1923, Marke Glov, in Poland, was enlightened. (Maybe it was because of her last name.) She learned the way of the glove, and is still living today. She is 114 years old. By Living <a href="../notdone.html">the way of the glove</a>, you too, can live very long, and become one of Glovenor's arms.</p>
        <h4>Who is glovenor?</h4>
        <p>Glovenor is the First god, and He/She (No one knows, but I will refer to Glovenor as a he for now.) And in his magnificence, Glovenor <a href="../notdone.html">created the universe.</a> Glovenor is the still master of <a href="gods.html" >the gods.</a> He has five legs and wears leather glove pants. His arms are his consultants, and his dead followers. By living the way of the glove, you to can live in glovenor's harmony, and become one of his arms. (Note that this is not true, and none of this should be belived.)</p>
