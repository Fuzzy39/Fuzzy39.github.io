					<h2>Games?</h2>
					<p>Well, kind of. not all of these are garenteed to be games, but the're interactve to some degree, and are all made by me. All of the things on this page can also be run right in your browser. If you want to try some, just look below.
					</p>
					
					
					<h3>Anvil</h3>
					<p>Anvil is probably my most impressive game. In it, you try to dodge falling anvils, and collect golden anvils to gain health. It was made with Adobe Flash.
					</p>
					<a href="anvil.html"> Play here. </a>
					<br>
					
					<h3>Away</h3>
					<p>Away is a text-adventury thing where you hear a knock on your door. It isn't very impressive, But it's fun for a few minutes. See if you can get all 6 endings. It was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>
					<a href="away.html"> Play here. </a>
					<br>
					<h3>Clicky</h3>
					<p> clicky is an experimennt in idle games. There are two versions, one made in Flash that is rather crude, and another with HTML and javascript which is less so, but dosen't save. you can play both here. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Flash version: <a href="Clicky/Clicky ( Flash ).html">play here.</a></li>
						<li>HTML version: <a href="Clicky/Clicky ( HTML ).html">play here.</a></li>
					</ul>
