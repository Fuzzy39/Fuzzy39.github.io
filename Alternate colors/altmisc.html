        <p>This is the blank style. In reality, this has no style at all. This is how Html looks naturaly. You have to appreciate the coders who toil tirelessly to produce beutiful websites. I can produce only decent web pages. If you look hard enough, you can find ancient web pages part of universities near the internet's invention and other more recent webpages tht people made and simply did not care how it looked. Of course nowadays you could just use Wordpress, but coding experience is always useful. Think of the people who made Wordpress. they had to know coding, yes?</p>
        <p>Anyways, I have rambled on long enough. I'll let you do whatever you were planing to do now.</p>
