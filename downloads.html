					<h2>Downloadable Things</h2>
					<p>Sometimes I make things that can run in the browser. When I feel like it, I put them here. These are typically not games, but maybe, who knows. They will work best on windows. Have fun with them, I guess.

						 I tried to make a programming shell. It's pretty primitive. It has an interactive help system, but to learn how it works, I 
						would use Examples.txt. Have fun messing around, if you care.
						
						Also, fo mac users, it expects the folder to be on your desktop.

						<button onClick="nav(&#34;downloads/Project Earth v0.1.0.766.zip&#34;)">Project Earth v0.1.0</button>
						<p>
						 I tried to make a... thing. It didn't ever really get finished, but in it's current state it's a map generator. It's pretty custimizable, but don't set the map size too high or it lags. Windows only.
						 I made it with Monogame, and I still like the idea so I might revisit it in some form.
