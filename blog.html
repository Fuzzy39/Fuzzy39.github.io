        <h4>Month of November, 2017</h4>
        <p>Week 1</p>
        <p>So, the website Has launched. That's good. There's still more for me to do with this until it's done. the glovenor pages are mostly empty. the 'other stuff' catergory  only has one style. As I'm writing this the home page is just a place holder, although you may not see it that way. There's more to do, and I'm going to be working on it. Back to work, then.</p>
