					<h2>Portfolio</h2>
					<p>As it turns out, I can draw. Not well, mind you, but I can. This page is intended to show what I, on some occasions, make. This is only for my graphics 
						design class at the moment, but that could change. Cool, right? No? Okay, whatever, you do you.</p>
					
					
					<h2>Minimalist Logos.</h2>
					<h3>Insperation</h3>
					<p>
I just learned how to use Adobe Illiustrator. it uses vector graphics instead of Raster, Which is new to me. I shoved a bunch of hexagons together and messed about, and I suddenly had a logo. My other Flag logo was made mostly because I thought it was cool. I also made a face, which is in my usual stickman style.</p>
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>
I am generally happy with how my artwork turned out. My attempt at a cartoon face failed desperately.

I was still unsure how to use illustrator, but it may have been the concept that failed. My other designs, however,  I am far more proud of, most so is my hexagon design. It is what I put, by far, the most work into. My flag design is also decent. I learned a lot about illustrator during this process.</p>

					<h2>Monograms</h2>
					<p> Experiments with text and letters and whatnot. </p>
					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
					<p>I was told To create Designs with letters. I first had to figure out what letters to use. I first Picked my own and the ones of the preson beside me, then I picked in a some what random fashion the letters T, E, and L. AAfter some sketching, I was able to find good and uniqe ways to desplay All of theese, MH in a jagged fashion, LH in a cursive manner, and Tel in a more bubbly Text.</p>
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p> I am happy with how all of these turned out. Most of all though, is the Tel logo. I was playing with the gradiaent and found this most interesting.</p>

					<h2>Buissness Cards</h2>
					<p> Using the mongrams to an effect. Not a great one, but whatever.</p>
					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
					<p>The class was told to create buissness cards. I used my logos from earlier and slaped text on, more or less.</p>
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>I feel that I could have put more effort into these, but they seem presntable enough. My last one I tried to experiment with angle, and it wasn't to poor.</p>

					<h2>Flyers</h2>
					<p>Get the word out, in a graphical way.</p>
					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
					<p>I recently made a game. You can se it <a href="https://qwerty4967.github.io/games/Clicky/Clicky%203/index.html">Here, </a> but that doens't matter much. I wanted to make a flyer for it, as I wanted more people to know about it. I probably wouldn't have made it without this class, but I think it was a good idea. </p>
					<H3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>I think I did well on this project.</p>
