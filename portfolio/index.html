					<h2>Portfolio</h2>
					<p>As it turns out, I can draw. Not well, mind you, but I can. This page is intended to show what I, on some occasions, make. This is only for my graphics 
						design class at the moment, but that could change. Cool, right? No? Okay, whatever, you do you.</p>
					
					
					<h2>Minimalist Logos.</h2>
					<h3>Insperation</h3>
					<p>
I just learned how to use Adobe Illiustrator. it uses vector graphics instead of Raster, Which is new to me. I shoved a bunch of hexagons together and messed about, and I suddenly had a logo. My other Flag logo was made mostly because I thought it was cool. I also made a face, which is in my usual stickman style.</p>
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>
I am generally happy with how my artwork turned out. My attempt at a cartoon face failed desperately.

I was still unsure how to use illustrator, but it may have been the concept that failed. My other designs, however,  I am far more proud of, most so is my hexagon design. It is what I put, by far, the most work into. My flag design is also decent. I learned a lot about illustrator during this process.</p>

					<h2>Monograms</h2>
					<p> Experiments with text and letters and whatnot. </p>
					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
					<p>I was told To create Designs with letters. I first had to figure out what letters to use. I first Picked my own and the ones of the preson beside me, then I picked in a some what random fashion the letters T, E, and L. AAfter some sketching, I was able to find good and uniqe ways to desplay All of theese, MH in a jagged fashion, LH in a cursive manner, and Tel in a more bubbly Text.</p>
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p> I am happy with how all of these turned out. Most of all though, is the Tel logo. I was playing with the gradiaent and found this most interesting.</p>

					<h2>Flyers</h2>
					<p>Get the word out, in a graphical way.</p>
					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
					<p>I recently made a game. You can see it <a href="https://qwerty4967.github.io/games/Clicky/Clicky%203/index.html">Here, </a> but that doens't matter much. I wanted to make a flyer for it, as I wanted more people to know about it. I probably wouldn't have made it without this class, but I think it was a good idea. </p>
					<H3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>I think I did well on this project. Things might be a bit cluttered, and the gold everywhere may look a bit strange, but over all, I think the flyer looks good.</p>

					<h2>Social Issue project</h2>
					<p>If I ought to be outraged, let's make it something petty.</p>
					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
					<p>Our class was told to think of a social issue, and I wanted an esoteric and rather bland issue. I picked pennies. After all, I couldn't think anyone would lose a tear if pennies were here or not.</p>
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>This project went well-ish. Could've been better. Currently, the poster feels disjointed and awkward. Perhaps with an introducory blurb, this could be resolved? I'm not sure, but at least the graphics are nice. </p>

					<h2>Fusion/magazine cover</h2>
					<p>We have gained the knowledge to warp reality! It wasn't that hard, really.</p>
					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
					<p>Our class was told to fuse two animals. This reminded me of a <a href="xkcd.com/1949/">xkcd</a> where fruit are colided.</p>
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>I think I did well on this project. Other than it looking somewhat phalic in nature, the fuision looks fairly natural.</p>

					<h2>Currency Project</h2>
					<p> Money, but different! </p>
					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
					<p>While we were being shown the currency concept,I noticed two cicles inscribed in another, which got me thinking about something I had learned about earlier, known as a Apollonian gasket, which got me inot thinking about a coin made of coins.</p>
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>THe idea behind the image may be unfesible, but the coins could be made of something lighter, like aluminum, with a coating of alluminum bronze. The art itself is servicable, but might be able to be done better.</p>

					<h2>Menu Project</h2>
					<p> food, but different! </p>
					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
					<p>We needed to make resurant menus, so I conceived of a the resurant with the simpilest menu to create.</p>
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>The menu itself looks fine, and the images could be much better, but the text is good. kinda.</p>
