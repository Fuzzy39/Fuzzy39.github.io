					<h2>Portfolio</h2>
					<p>As it turns out, I can draw. Not well, mind you, but I can. This page is intended to show what I, on some occasions, make. This is only for my graphics 
						design class at the moment, but that could change. Cool, right? No? Okay, whatever, you do you.</p>

							<h3>Inspiration</h3>
							<p>I just learned how to use Adobe Illiustrator. it uses vector graphics instead of Raster, Which is new to me. I shoved a bunch of hexagons together and messed about, and I suddenly had a logo.
							My other Flag logo was made mostly because I thought it was cool. I also made a face, which is in my usual stickman style. It went poorly.</p>
