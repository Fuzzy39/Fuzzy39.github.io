					<h2>Clicky</h2>
					<p> When I first thought about making a game, I figured that an idle game would be the easiest thing to make.
					And so Clicky was born. Unfortunately Clicky 1 isn't playable today, but it probably won't be missed.
					In Clicky, you click for gold. Have fun!
					</p>
					<p>All of these 'technically' work on mobile, but they are in no way designed to, so try at your own risk there.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky 4/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 4</button>
						<p> Clicky 4 is the latest and greatest clicky there is! Though it's still at best, kinda fun. Originally I had some rather 
						ambitious plans to make an 'idle' game called Titans of Industry, and figured that developing this would allow me to create an 'engine' of sorts for it.
						Not the worst idea, but perhaps a bit too ambitious. Maybe I'll revisit it someday, who knows. Clicky 4 itself is somewhat similar to Clicky 3, 
						at least on the outside. There's a lot of additions and nice bits though.</p>
				
					</div>
					
					<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky 3/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 3</button>
						<p> Clicky 3 is a gold mining Idle game. After a few iterations, clicky is looking alright. First you mine gold and hire miners to help you do it a bit faster, then drills,
					     and you're sucked into the rabbit hole. There isn't that much content though, to be honest. Clicky 3 was made with pixi.js.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky 2/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 2</button>
						<p>Clicky 2 is where I learned enough about html, css, and javascript to think I could make a game with it. I was wrong, of course, but hey, something came out of the effort at least. </p>
					</div>
					<br>
					
					<h2>Joke Versions</h2>
					<p>I also made some sillier, clicky 'games', 'cause why not?</p>
					<br>
					
					<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;ClickySpin/index.html&#34;)">Clicky Spin</button>
						<p>Miner goes 'round and 'round... when does he stop? Nobody knows! Clicky spin was basically me learning how to use Unity. A little bit of fun, no? </p>
				
					</div>
					<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky 3 Crab/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 3: Crab Mode</button>
						<p>A friend of mine insisted on it. So here it is. Don't ask too many questions.</p>
