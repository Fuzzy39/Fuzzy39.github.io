
Features:
	*Legacy Icon
	preformance enhancements - the game now runs much better, close double FPS, though not really 60. (30 -> 50 FPS on the computer I tested)
	Major rebalance - 
		miners and drills are now more competitive compared to Lasers (though not really by the time you get a Prospector)
		Upgrading the Prospector is now worthwhile ( 3 -> 1.5 )
		Legacy bonus is different somehow (not exactly sure)
		Smarter Lasers are 100% more expensive, though they get less expensive over time ( 100k -> 200k )( 1.6 -> 1.42 )

Fixes:	
	GPS readouts now adjust for gold bonus
	Fixed that Panel menu failed to update when buying Prospector with it open
	Fixed bug where the prospect button would not unlock when gold reserves were high
	Fixed lucky break never triggering. Whoops.
