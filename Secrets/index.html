						<p>Hey! Welcome to my secrets page. Why do I have a secret page, you ask? Well I put old stuff I am no longer proud of on here, and possibly stuff that is in development, or maybe easter eggs.
						  I don't particularly have an Idea fo this, we'll see how this goes. I suppose this will just be a giant list, I don't want to make this as large as the main site.
						  So, Let's see... What do we have here?
						</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Easter Eggs / In Development</h2>
						
						
							<p>Oof, nothing...</p>
						<br>
						
						<h2>Old Stuff</h2>
						
						<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;https://github.com/qwerty4967/Clicky/releases/tag/v0.2.0.355&#34;)">Clicky Drive Alpha 2</button>
						<p> A new engine for clicky? Try it out, it's pretty early access.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="descriptor">
							<button onClick="nav(&#34;Anvil/anvil.swf&#34;)">Anvil</button>
							<p>In Anvil you try to dodge falling anvils and you can collect golden anvils to gain health. If you live long enough, you win! It was made with Adobe Flash, so good luck playing it.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky1/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 1</button>
						<p>Ever wondered why there was a clicky 3 on the website, but not 1 or 2? It's because they are awful in comparison. Clicky 1 is a flash game, so as time goes on it will become unplayable, but trust me, you didn't miss a thing.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Prego/index.html&#34;)">Don't Get Pregnant</button>
						<p>Oh god, not this again. Can we all just collectively forget about this one?</p>
