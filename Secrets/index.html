						<p>Hey! Welcome to my secrets page. Why do I have a secret page, you ask? Well I put old stuff I am no longer proud of on here, and possibly stuff that is in development, or maybe easter eggs.
						  I don't particularly have an Idea fo this, we'll see how this goes. I suppose this will just be a giant list, I don't want to make this as large as the main site.
						  So, Let's see... What do we have here?
						</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Easter Eggs / In Development</h2>
						
						<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;https://github.com/qwerty4967/Clicky/releases/tag/v0.2.0.355&#34;)">Clicky Drive Alpha 2</button>
						<p> A new engine for clicky? Try it out, it's pretty early access.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky3/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 3: Crab Mode</button>
						<p> It's the same as clicky 3 on the main page! Except, it's crabs! Why? I don't know. Must be an inside joke or something...</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Project Earth v0.1.0.766.zip&#34;)">Project Earth (v0.1.0.766)</button>
						<p>This is a... niche thing that I had worked on for a while. might pick it up again. It is a download for windows if you want to check it out. The current version is a map generator, feel free to mess around with it if you want.</p>
						</div>
						<br>
						<h2>Old Stuff</h2>
						<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky1/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 1</button>
						<p>Ever wondered why there was a clicky 3 on the website, but not 1 or 2? It's because they are awful in comparison. Clicky 1 is a flash game, so as time goes on it will become unplayable, but trust me, you didn't miss a thing.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky2/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 2</button>
						<p>Ever wondered why there was a clicky 3 on the website, but not 1 or 2? It's because they are awful in comparison. Clicky 2 is Vaugely reminiscent of clicky 3 and isn
						t without any merit, but there isn't anything here really.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="descriptor">
						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Prego/index.html&#34;)">Don't Get Pregnant</button>
						<p>Oh god, not this again. Can we all just collectively forget about this one?</p>
