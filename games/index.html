					<h2>Interactives</h2>
					<p> When I make Interactive in-browser things, they tend to go here. They're mostly games, but I might put other things here at some point. Have some fun with them if you want. More recent things are at the top, so they are probably better, but you can be the judge of that. I don't expect that any of these will work on mobile either, but you can try your luck if you want.
					</p>

						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky/Clicky 4/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 4</button>
						<p> Clicky 4 is a gold mining idle game made with Phaser. I had some ambitions for a game loosely based on clicky, so I set out to make an engine for it and thought I would build a new clicky with it too. I think it's pretty nice. It has non-disgusting code, a lot of visual improvements and a couple nice new features, along with a general rebalance. Try it out, if you want to.</p>

						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky/Clicky 3/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 3</button>
						<p> Clicky 3 is a gold mining Idle game. After a few iterations, clicky is looking alright. First you mine gold and hire miners to help you do it a bit faster, then drills,
					     and you're sucked into the rabbit hole. There isn't that much content though, to be honest. Clicky 3 was made with pixi.js.</p>

						<button onClick="nav(&#34;away.html&#34;)">Away</button>
						<p>Away is a text-adventury thing where you hear a knock on your door. It isn't very impressive, But it's fun for a few minutes. See if you can get all 6 endings. It was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>
