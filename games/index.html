					<h2>Interactives</h2>
					<p> I've made some Interactive in-browser things. Mostly games, but I might put other things. I don't trust any of these to work on mobile, but you can try your luck if you want. Have some fun with them if you want to.
					</p>
					
					
					
					<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky/Clicky 3/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 3</button>
					<p> Clicky 3 is a gold mining Idle game. </p>
					
					
					
					<button onClick="nav(&#34;anvil.html&#34;)">Anvil</button>
					<p>Anvil is probably my most impressive game. In it, you try to dodge falling anvils, and collect golden anvils to gain health. It was made with Adobe Flash.
					</p>

					<button onClick="nav(&#34;away.html&#34;)">Away</button>
					<p>Away is a text-adventury thing where you hear a knock on your door. It isn't very impressive, But it's fun for a few minutes. See if you can get all 6 endings. It was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>
