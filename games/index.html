					<h2>Interactives</h2>
					<p> When I make Interactive in-browser things, they tend to go here. They're mostly games, but I might put other things here at some point. Have some fun with them if you want. More recent things are at the top, so they are probably better, but you can be the judge of that. I don't expect that any of these will work on mobile either, but you can try your luck if you want.
					</p>

						<button onClick="nav(&#34;Clicky/Clicky 3/index.html&#34;)">Clicky 3</button>
						<p> Clicky 3 is a gold mining Idle game. After a few iterations, clicky is looking alright. First you mine gold and hire miners to help you do it a bit faster, then drills,
					     and you're sucked into the rabbit hole. There isn't that much content though, to be honest. Clicky 3 was made with pixi.js.</p>

						<button onClick="nav(&#34;anvil.html&#34;)">Anvil</button>
						<p>In Anvil you try to dodge falling anvils and you can collect golden anvils to gain health. If you live long enough, you win! It was made with Adobe Flash.

						<button onClick="nav(&#34;away.html&#34;)">Away</button>
						<p>Away is a text-adventury thing where you hear a knock on your door. It isn't very impressive, But it's fun for a few minutes. See if you can get all 6 endings. It was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>
